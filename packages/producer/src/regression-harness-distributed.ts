/**
 * Distributed-render path for the regression harness.
 *
 * The regression harness has two modes:
 *
 *   - `in-process` (default) — calls `executeRenderJob`, the same path the
 *     `hyperframes render` CLI takes. This is what produced every existing
 *     `tests/<name>/output/output.mp4` golden baseline.
 *
 *   - `distributed-simulated` — calls `plan()` → `renderChunk()` per chunk
 *     → `assemble()` from `@hyperframes/producer/distributed`. No Temporal
 *     or Lambda involvement: the controller and chunk worker are both this
 *     process, but they go through the same artifact (planDir + frozen
 *     `meta/encoder.json` + per-chunk concat-copy) that a real fan-out
 *     would.
 *
 * Both modes share the per-fixture `minPsnr` threshold — distributed must
 * pass the same quality bar the in-process renderer passes against the
 * same frozen baseline. A separate {@link DISTRIBUTED_SIMULATED_MIN_PSNR_DB}
 * pathology floor catches the case where a fixture authored a permissive
 * threshold and distributed regresses to fully-black output. The §5.1
 * 50 dB target was written for per-render comparison (fresh in-process vs
 * fresh distributed); against the frozen baseline file it's unreachable
 * for either mode due to shared encoder/JPEG-capture jitter, so the
 * harness can't use it as a per-test gate.
 *
 * Not every fixture can run in distributed-simulated mode. Distributed mode
 * refuses webm, HDR mp4, NTSC framerates, and non-{24,30,60} fps at plan
 * time. Fixtures that don't meet the constraints are skipped — the harness
 * logs the reason and the fixture is treated as "passed (skipped)" in
 * distributed-simulated mode.
